## Mission üéØ

Welcome to KEVIN, an open-source project that aims to support and help our young technology enthusiasts, from AI software developer replacing tools like [Devin](https://www.cognition-labs.com/introducing-devin), an autonomous AI software engineer who is capable of executing complex engineering tasks and collaborating actively with users on software development projects. This project aspires to INNOVATE, ENHANCE, and replicate upon Devin through the power of the open-source community.

## ü§î What is [Devin](https://www.cognition-labs.com/introducing-devin)?

Devin represents a cutting-edge autonomous agent designed to navigate the complexities of software engineering. It leverages a combination of tools such as a shell, code editor, and web browser, showcasing the untapped potential of LLMs in software development.

## üêö Why Kevin?

There are lots of cut off in the software developers especially in entry-level and juniors. The upcoming AI software engineers are eating our young technology enthusiasts, we don't have to let them. We have to support them. Our goal is to create, train and instruct a model on top of LLMs or GPTs, that can do tasks of Software Engineers, our aim is not make a rivalry to Devin or compete with Devin, our main target is create AI Software Engineer using open code models, so every developer in the world can use, and get benefit from it.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Research Strategy

Achieving full production-ready AI Software Engineer with LLMs is a complex endeavor. Our strategy involves:

**Let's imagine you are trying to teach a junior developers. How do you approach this problem? What steps should you take, and what steps should he take, and how he should behave. Depending on how precise we can be, so it can learn quickly. Then try to convert your thoughts into language[prompt] that computer understands.**

1. **Core Technical Research:** Focusing on foundational research to understand and improve the technical aspects of code generation and handling. We are planning more than web tasks...
2. **Specialist Abilities:** Enhancing the effectiveness of core components through data curation, training methods, and more.
3. **Task Planning:** Developing capabilities for bug detection, codebase management, and optimization.
4. **Evaluation:** Establishing comprehensive evaluation metrics to better understand and improve our models.

## üõ† Technology Stack

- **Sandboxing Environment:** Ensuring safe execution of code using technologies like Docker and Kubernetes.
- **Frontend Interface:** Developing user-friendly interfaces for monitoring progress and interacting with Kevin, potentially leveraging frameworks like React or creating a VSCode plugin for a more integrated experience.

## üöÄ Next Steps

- **Literature Review:** Conduct a thorough review of existing literature (1-2 weeks).
- **Community Engagement:** Release the plan to the community, form research groups, and begin collaborative work.

## How to Contribute

Kevin is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions from everyone. Whether you're a developer, a researcher, or simply enthusiastic about advancing the field of software engineering with AI, there are many ways to get involved:

- **Code Contributions:** Help us develop the core functionalities, frontend interface, or sandboxing solutions[DevOps engineers are warmly welcomed].
- **Research and Evaluation:** Contribute to our understanding of LLMs in software engineering, participate in evaluating the models, or suggest improvements.
- **Feedback and Testing:** Use the OpenDevin toolset, report bugs, suggest features, or provide feedback on usability.

**Please fill in the [form](https://forms.gle/RVS5Z9CnXjuhZ5QT9) if you would like to become a core member of Kevin Team. We will reach out shortly if we feel you are a good fit to the current team!**

## Stay Connected

Join our community to stay updated on Kevin's progress, share your ideas, and collaborate with fellow enthusiasts and experts. Together, we can make significant strides towards simplifying software engineering tasks and creating more efficient, powerful tools for developers everywhere.
